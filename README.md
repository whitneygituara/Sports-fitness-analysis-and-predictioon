Sports Injury Prediction and Prevention using Machine learning
# Injury Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of injuries based on various features such as age, weight, height, training intensity, and recovery time. The dataset is processed, analyzed, and modeled using logistic regression in R.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Load and Explore the Data
- Load the dataset into R.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand:
  - Data distribution
  - Missing values
  - Correlations between variables

### 2. Preprocess the Data
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Normalize/scale numerical features (e.g., age, weight, height, training intensity, recovery time).
- Encode categorical variables (if any).

### 3. Split the Data
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

### 4. Build a Machine Learning Model
- Use logistic regression to predict the likelihood of injury.
- Train the model on the training set.

### 5. Evaluate the Model
- Evaluate the model's performance using ROC-AUC.
- Test the model on the testing set.

### 6. Interpret Results
- Analyze feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to injury likelihood.
- Provide insights for injury prevention based on model findings.

## Requirements
- R programming language
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `ROCR`, `ggplot2`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kidigapeet/Sports-fitness-analysis-and-predictioon.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Sports-fitness-analysis-and-predictioon
   ```
3. Install required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "ROCR", "ggplot2"))
   ```

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Run the logistic regression model.
3. Evaluate performance and interpret results.
4. Generate insights for injury prevention.
